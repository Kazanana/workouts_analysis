# Main idea
I got FitNotes app that lets me export data in a csv.
Right now I need to start using the app and if there is something that I need and app doesnt offer, I will try to manipulate csv file.

# Upload my old notes to the app
In the app there's an option to restore data from backup. Backup is in sqlite3 format. In order to automatically upload my data to app I need to create a database file from my old notes.
First I need to fill in couple of workouts to see how the database with my inputs look like. Then I need to write python script that will convert my old notes into database.
